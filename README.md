# FACS_NGS

This project focused on using FACS-NGS method to profile the response of thousands of biosensor mutants. Briefly, Based on library consisted of thousands of synthetic sensor mutants, FACS-seq can be adopted to profile the response curve (reporter expressions vs. a series of ligand concentrations) for each individual mutant in living cells.

It consisted of two sub packages. 

One is the simulation package, used simulation method to guide the experiment design;

Another is the data processing package, used to convert the raw NGS .fq data from FACS-NGS experiments, based on the customized configure file to sensor response profile.

About the usage of each sub package, please check the readme.txt under relevant directory.

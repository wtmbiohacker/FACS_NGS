# FACS-NGS

This project focused on using FACS-NGS method to profile the response of thousands of biosensor mutants.

It consisted of two sub packages. 

One is the simulation package, used simulation method to guide the experiment design;

Another is the data processing package, used to convert the raw NGS .fq data, based on the customized configure file to sensor response profile.

About the usage of each sub package, please check the readme.txt under relevant directory.
